# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Purpose: I am a old school back end developer.  I want to become familiar with front end development so that I can potentially broaden my career opportunities.

### Day 1: 13 Nov 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started walking throught the Wes Bos JavaScript 30 tutorial

**Thoughts:** I had to start some where.  I also did some kata's on CodeWars

**Link to work:** [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/)

### Day 2 14 Nov 2019

#Day 2 CSS Variables

**Today's Progress**: #javascript30 lessons 2 & 3 

Learned how to update variables via controls and use those variables to update elements on the page.  sliders updated the padding of an image.  A color selector updated the background of a element.  I learned that you can override the base var to specify a different value for a given element.

node list vs array 

   - node list does not have all of the functions or controls of an array.  node list is not as powerful

data attributes are attributes added to an element object.  They need to be prefix "data-".

**Thoughts:** I am going to be tired.

### Day 3 15 Nov 2019

**Today's Progress**
Reviewed the arrays from lesson 4.  Need to play around with the one that scrapped the elements off of wiki.

Finished the Flex Panel exercise.  The little spellilng mistakes are killing me.  Flex Panel is very similar to one of the old school java panel types. So  old I can remember it.  Chopping away.  Need to find that other tutorial on the flex panel.
