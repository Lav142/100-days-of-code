# 100 Days Of Code - Log

Purpose: I am a old school back end developer.  I want to become familiar with front end development so that I can potentially broaden my career opportunities.

### Day 0: 13 Nov 2019

**Today's Progress**: Started walking throught the Wes Bos JavaScript 30 tutorial

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
